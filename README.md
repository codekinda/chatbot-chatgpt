Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot using OpenAI's ChatGPT model. ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model trained to generate human-like text based on the input provided. By leveraging the power of ChatGPT, this chatbot can engage in conversations on a variety of topics in a natural and coherent manner.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: ChatGPT processes user input and generates responses that are contextually relevant.

Customizable: You can tailor the chatbot by adjusting parameters such as the model size, temperature (which controls the randomness of responses), and maximum tokens (limiting the length of generated responses).

Easy Integration: Integrates seamlessly with messaging platforms or as a standalone application.
